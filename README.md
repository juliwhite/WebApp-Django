# Overview

I want to be able to insert a list of activities to a database and I also want to be able to see the insertions. I also want to be able to add some functionality to this project like modify it and delete in case of mistake in the insertion. 

The way to initiate the program is from the terminal. Once to open the terminal you type the file 'manage.py' with the command 'runserver'. Then it will show you an http direction which is your local host. You can open this on google chrome. 

The purpose of this project is to be able to keep track of all the activities that are develop in a primary activity group. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
